I ran across an issue where staff was using th edescription field for title.
This will move the description field to the title field

# Setup as many OU pre reqs as you may need

$MQO = 'OU=Users,OU=    ,OU=   ,DC=   ,DC=local




$Users = Get-ADUser -Filter { Description -like '*' } -SearchBase "$MQ" -Properties Description

foreach( $User in $Users ){
    try{
        Set-ADObject -Identity $User.DistinguishedName -Replace @{ Title = $User.Description } -ErrorAction Stop -ErrorVariable 'ErrorMessage'

        Write-Verbose "Successfully set title for $($User.Name)" -Verbose
        }
    catch{
        Write-Warning "Failed to set title for $($User.Name)"
        Write-Warning "UserName: $($User.SamAccountName)`tDescription: $($User.Description)"
        Write-Warning "Error Message:`n$ErrorMessage"
        }  
    }
